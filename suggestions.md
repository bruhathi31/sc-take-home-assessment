These are my suggestions on how to improve the initial code:
- GetAllFolders:
    - Remove unused variables
    - Add error handling
    - Simplify the logic by using the result from FetchAllFoldersByOrgID, instead of converting []*Folder to []Folder and back to []*Folder 
    - Add input validation
- FetchAllFoldersByOrgID:
    - Add input validation
    - Use a deferred function in order to recover from potential panics in GetSampleData, this way if a panic occurs, it will return an error
      instead of letting the error propagate
    - Pre-allocate the reult slice with a capacity equal to the the length of the result from GetSampleData, in order to have better performance
